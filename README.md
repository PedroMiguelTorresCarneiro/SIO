# Informatics and Organizational Security

## Objectives

The aim of this course is to provide an overview of the field of Information Security, with a particular emphasis on the security challenges faced by organizations. These challenges will be highlighted in terms of information security and infrastructure security (machines and networks).

This course will focus on the basic aspects of information security, the definition of security policies, and their implementation using various security mechanisms.

Additionally, ethical, legal, and social issues of security in organizations will be addressed.

## Learning Outcomes

Knowledge about the security vulnerabilities of networked computer systems, the problems that these vulnerabilities can pose if they are known and exploited, the theoretical solutions currently known to eliminate vulnerabilities, and the technical solutions that are currently used, at various levels and with different objectives, to ensure security attributes.

## 1st Practical Project: Vulnerabilities

It involved an in-depth analysis and exploration of various security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. The project aimed to provide hands-on experience in identifying, assessing, and proposing mitigation strategies for these vulnerabilities.

This project was a key component of the course, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. 

GRADED: **15.6 out of 20** - reflecting a strong understanding and application of the course materials and concepts.
